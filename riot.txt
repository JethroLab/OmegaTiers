 OmegaTiers is a Twitch extension that appears on a streamer panel. Any streamer can install it for free. Any viewer on the Twitch channel has access to it for free.

 The extension is giving information about a chosen player.
A user on Twitch can use a search bar to fetch information about a League of Legend player. The API we are using are:
--SUMMONER-V4
--LEAGUE-V4
--MATCH-V5

 We build this app because we though it would be really convenient for LoL communities on Twitch to be able to access those kind of information without leaving Twitch.

 The information OmegaTiers displays exclusively comes from Riot API.
